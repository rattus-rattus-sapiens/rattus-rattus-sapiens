## About me
I am a postgraduate student at the EPSRC Centre for Doctoral Training in Statistical Applied Mathematics at the University of Bath.

The overarching theme of my research is the design and analysis of stochastic representations of biological systems, with a particular focus on the migration, proliferation, and age structure of cellular populations as mediated by the cell cycle, and on viewing biological systems through the lens of both continuum and stochastic methodologies. I currently work on the spatio-temporal modelling of age-structured cellular populations via hybrid simulation techniques, which combine continuum descriptions such as PDEs with stochastic simulation algorithms to improve model accuracy and reduce computational cost.
